# Flood--Warning
IoT-Based Flood Warning System
Introduction:
The IoT-based Flood Warning System is designed to address the adverse effects of global warming-induced floods in Swat, Pakistan. Swat, being a region prone to heavy rainfall and flash floods, requires an effective early warning system to mitigate potential damages and save lives. This system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor, NodeMCU (an ESP8266-based microcontroller), and ArcGIS for data visualization and mapping.

Components Used:

Ultrasonic Sensor: The ultrasonic sensor is responsible for measuring the water level in the rivers or water bodies. It emits ultrasonic waves and calculates the time taken for the waves to return after hitting the water surface. This data is then used to determine the water level.

NodeMCU (ESP8266): NodeMCU is an open-source microcontroller based on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. It acts as the heart of the system, collecting data from the ultrasonic sensor and transmitting it to the ArcGIS server for visualization.

ArcGIS: ArcGIS is a powerful geographical information system (GIS) that provides tools for data visualization, mapping, and spatial analysis. It will be used to display real-time water level data and flood-prone areas in Swat, Pakistan.

Working Principle:
The ultrasonic sensor is installed near the river or water body at a suitable height to measure the water level accurately. The sensor continuously emits ultrasonic waves and calculates the time taken for the waves to bounce back. Using the speed of sound in air, the distance between the sensor and water surface is calculated.

The NodeMCU reads data from the ultrasonic sensor and establishes a Wi-Fi connection to the internet. It then sends the water level data to the ArcGIS server at regular intervals. The ArcGIS server processes the incoming data and generates real-time flood risk maps and visualizations for Swat, Pakistan.

NodeMCU Code:
Below is a basic outline of the NodeMCU code for the Flood Warning System. Keep in mind that this is a simplified version, and you might need to adapt it based on your specific ultrasonic sensor and ArcGIS setup.
